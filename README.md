# GPUsuba
High-throughput cryptography on GPUs


This project aim to describe high-level cryptography in [Usuba](https://dadaiscrazy.github.io/usuba/ "Usuba project's Homepage") language for high-throughput cryptography on GPUs.

It splits into several parts and the first one is a search among literature for AES' code and benchmarks implemented in CUDA to have a strong reference to compare to.
