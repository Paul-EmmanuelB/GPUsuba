engine-cuda / engine-opencl
===========================

engine-cuda is an engine for the popular OpenSSL cryptography framework. It
enables the execution of different block ciphers on a GPU using CUDA and
OpenCL. Currently, the following block ciphers are supported:

* AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 (ECB, CBC decryption)
* Blowfish (ECB, CBC decryption)
* CAST5 (ECB, CBC decryption)
* Camellia-128 (ECB, CBC decryption)
* DES (ECB, CBC decryption)
* IDEA (ECB, CBC decryption)

Building engine-cuda
--------------------

In order to build and use engine-cuda you will need

* CUDA toolkit installed
* patched OpenSSL (see +openssl-patch+ directory)
* gcc etc.

In order to generate a Makefile you have to call configure first. 

  ./configure

You might have to supply configure with the path to your CUDA toolkit:
 
  ./configure --with-cudatoolkitpath=/opt/cuda

Some helpful autoconf flags:

  --with-gpuarch=sm_xx (to make nvcc compile for a certain compute capability)
  --with-buffersize=<bytes> (to set the size of the staging buffer between CPU and GPU)
  --with-maxrregcount=<regs> (to set the maximum registers per kernel thread)
  --disable-libopencl (to disable building engine-opencl)

After that simply do

  make
  make install

For any further information please refer to http://code.google.com/p/engine-cuda/

Development
-----------
Further helpful autoconf switches for debugging and developing engine-cuda:

  --enable-debug (enables some verbose output)
  --enable-timing (necessary to get kernel execution timing output)
  --enable-verbose (enables verbose compilation output including register use)
  --disable-aes-coarse (use fine-grained implementation of AES)

Benchmarks of engine-cuda, engine-opencl and the individual kernels can be
performed using the files in the test/ subdirectory. For testing the whole
engine, call

  ./test-speed.sh <avg_runs> <GPUONLY/CPUONLY> <ciphers/"all"> <engine>

in test/plots subdir. Plots using gnuplot will automatically generated. Tests
with 5 iterations and for all block ciphers will take some time.

To test the raw kernel execution time, have a look at the 

 ./generate-files.sh <device> (/dev/zero or /dev/urandom)
 ./test-kernels.sh <key> <ciphers>

scripts in test/. This will generate files using the device and run them
through the kernels.

During development, use 

  ./test-correctness.sh <cipher/"all"> <file> <key> <bufsize>
  
to compare the output of engine-cuda / engine_opencl with the CPU output in
order to ensure functionality of the algorithm.

Caveats
-------

There are many (very strange) problems which can arise when using and
developing CUDA and OpenCL. We have tried to identify these within the
documentation/source, but you may stumble on other problems as well.

For CUDA, using the compute-exclusive mode removes the initial lag:

   nvidia-smi -pm 1
   nvidia-smi -c 1

to set persistence-mode and compute-exclusive mode
